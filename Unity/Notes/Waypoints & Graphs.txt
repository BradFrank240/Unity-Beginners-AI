Waypoints & Graphs,
Found in Unity-AI-4-Beginners-Part2

11.Waypoints: Just showing off how waypoint can be used. Having a bot follow a series of places.
However implementation of getting the way points was just using the inspector and a public array.

12.Following a Circuit: Going to continue using the same scene. This part is about having the bots
that follow the waypoints collide with eachother and not just mesh together. 
Still having us use individual pieces for one bot, assumed so we can understand what the pieces
do before applying it to groups. Having physics has the user give up some control, such as objects
hitting each other and thus getting of track. To fix these sorts of problems, you can add a tracker
or object that goes along the waypoints instead that the tank follows. Have to make sure tracker doesn't
go to far from tank. 

13. Graph Theory & A* Nodes are places, and edges are paths. An edge that goes both ways are called 
undirected. An edge with only oneway, are directed. Two algorithsm for searching through nodes.
Breadth-first search, adding values to nodes based on distance from user. Best understood when visuals also not optimal.
A* is the most common algoritmem. In note terms, A* sends ghost out to seach and evalute the best paths.
Has you just implement the a* algortihm, all has already been coded. More just has you put stuff in place
that was already built. I'm going to re create once finsihed the whole course and create the A*
myself. Also have waypoints auto generate.
