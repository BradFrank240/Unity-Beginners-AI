Waypoints & Graphs,
Found in Unity-AI-4-Beginners-Part2

11.Waypoints: Just showing off how waypoint can be used. Having a bot follow a series of places.
However implementation of getting the way points was just using the inspector and a public array.

12.Following a Circuit: Going to continue using the same scene. This part is about having the bots
that follow the waypoints collide with eachother and not just mesh together. 
Still having us use individual pieces for one bot, assumed so we can understand what the pieces
do before applying it to groups. Having physics has the user give up some control, such as objects
hitting each other and thus getting of track. To fix these sorts of problems, you can add a tracker
or object that goes along the waypoints instead that the tank follows. Have to make sure tracker doesn't
go to far from tank.
