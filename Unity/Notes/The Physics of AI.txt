The Physics of AI

7. Time: The Update method runs once per frame, therefore if time was measured in update, than 
time would depend on framerate. Their is an excution order for methods. For Ai, focus on fixedUpdate,
Update and LateUpdate. Gives an example of the adam model in a scene. Late update and update both 
run once per frame. Fixxed update runs the physics as many times as it needs to. You can use
time.delta time to track time between updates. 

8. Velocity: v = distance / time. As you learned in school, velocity is the speed and direction
and object is moving.
