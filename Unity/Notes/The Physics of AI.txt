The Physics of AI

7. Time: The Update method runs once per frame, therefore if time was measured in update, than 
time would depend on framerate. Their is an excution order for methods. For Ai, focus on fixedUpdate,
Update and LateUpdate. Gives an example of the adam model in a scene. Late update and update both 
run once per frame. Fixxed update runs the physics as many times as it needs to. You can use
time.delta time to track time between updates. 

8. Velocity: v = distance / time. As you learned in school, velocity is the speed and direction
and object is moving. 

9.Acceleration: Just as velocity is the change in speed over time, acceleration is the change in velocity
over time. Acceleration's formula is F = ma. or acceleration = force / mass. Gravity is always applied.

10. Calculating Trajectories: A parabola is a force with no other force than gravity. I'm going
to be reusing the previous lesson scene as it is used again. Once the start of a parabola there
are no other forces applied, just gravity. This uses some pretty advacned math. X and Z axis messing
up as I created a 2d prodject, seems to be a common trend. Fixing bugs as I go. Might switch to 3D
after this Prodject in the course. A question mark at the end of a return value means it can return
both type and null.
