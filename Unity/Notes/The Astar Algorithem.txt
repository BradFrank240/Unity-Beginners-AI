A* Algorithem.

Part 1: The A* algorithem was made to find an optimal path to find the best path through an enviroment.
It's important to understand how the algorithem works. Basicly it's about finding the closest path possible.
We store values for everymovement the bot could make, this is refered to h, (h = cost to goal)
H could include cost as damage taken to move their and time. To keep simple, just use the distance.
g is the cost from th start, or how close this point is. Add these together to find your f value.
F value is compared between the two points or options you have. The lowest value is chosen and 
added to a closed list. And the new points their are calculated and we repeat until we find the lowest
f value. Once it found the path it will go backwords through the path and rember every node it went
through to get the end result.

Some reason the starting file is not avalible. I'm going to go ahead to navigation meshes and then
come back to here.
