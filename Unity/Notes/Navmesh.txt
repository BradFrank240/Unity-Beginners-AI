Had to skip to here so i can apply the a* algorithm.

The method orginally called a meta map. A navmesh is an auto generated map of the waypoints on a map.
They are not called bots, they are called agents, now they tell me. But they do all mean the same thing.
So the agents know about the navigation mesh in the world and it's values. You need to give the agents
the navigation agent component. And for object that are part of the navigation mesh, they should be
included in the navigation static propertie.
Alot of the things I coded unity will actually handle for me.
