A FSM or Finite state machine is a state pattern that can only 
exist in one state  at a time and transition to set states.
Created a new prodject to store these lessons as waypoints and graphs was very cluttered.

Finite State Machines: Different behaviors in different states, using the state patteren. 
As I have seen with my past FSM's, a state doesn't just have a enter and update method, but alos
a Exit method. Their is use of a singleton. However the way this state machine work is interesting, 
because it handles all the transitions. Therefore you don't have to manul say what to do on exit.
However this system also is creating the states on the fly which is sub optimal, I'll have to see if this
is addresed. She does mention that you should be passing through componenets and not using get componenet. 
Passing around the objects own data could bog down the pattern over time. I'll have to talk to an expert on the
area.
